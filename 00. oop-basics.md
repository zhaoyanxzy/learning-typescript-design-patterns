# Abstraction
- Abstraction is the creation of subclasses where the implementation complexities of the parent class are hidden.
- In other words: when a class calls a method from another class, the class calling the method does not need to bother with the implementation details of the method, treating the method as a black box.
- In simpler terms, abstraction is the hiding of implementations from other classes.
- Rationale: Reduce the complexity and omit unnecessary details in implementing the subclasses.
- TODO: Shift out design principles
- Design principle: **Program to an Interface, not an Implementation**
	- An "interface" of a class refers to the information that will be provided by/to a class.
	- Apply **polymorphism** to extract similar codes into a class.
	- Decoupled code improves the robustness of the code. When a part of the code changes, other parts remain unaffected.
	- TODO: Examples and how design principles are applied.

# Encapsulation
- Encapsulation can be performed on a "method level" in a class where the access to the methods is restricted to those from its class.
	-	Basically it means to make the encapsulated methods `private` or `protected` and other classes cannot access these methods.
- Hiding of data by setters also considered as encapsulation
- TODO: the difference between `private` and `protected`
- It could also be performed on a "class level" where the methods from a class are separated into a class of its own.
- Design principle: **Encapsulate What Varies**

# Inheritance
- Inheritance is the implementation of a class hierarchy in which the common attributes and methods can be grouped in a parent class that forms the base, while leaving the subclasses to have their own unique implementation details.
- Abstract out common attributes and methods of classes into a parent class AND
- Override methods in the subclasses or extend methods for specific needs
- When to use:
	- The '<subclass> "is-a" <superclass>' test
	- Rationale: DRY code
- When not to use:
	- Not to use inheritance if the classes don't have a is-a relationship, even though code can be reused by abstracted out

# Polymorphism
- Subclasses created from a common parent class are related to one another through inheritance. Even though methods are inherited from the parent class, polymorphism occurs when these inherited methods behave differently in the implementation of each of the subclass.
- Simplify and reduce code.
- A polymorphed object returns true for `instanceof` tests, i.e. the object "is-a" <something> of a class.
